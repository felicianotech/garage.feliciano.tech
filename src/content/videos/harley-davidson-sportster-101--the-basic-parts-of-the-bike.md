I walk around my Harley Davidson Iron 883 and explain what most of the parts are and what they are for.
Not everyone has the same level of knowledge when it comes to motorcycles.
This video is a quick walk around of the bike to explain what some of the major parts are.
This won't cover every part and won't go into much detail.
Just enough to give you a brief understanding of a Harley-Davidson motorcycle.
